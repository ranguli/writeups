# K.K's Mixtape - uiuctf 2020

_Hmm something is up with this wav file but I dont know what it is please help me :)_

Challenge by Pranav

All you need to do is open the `SuchAudacity.wav` file in Audacity and change
from **waveform view** to **spectogram view**, a tutorial on which can be found
[here](https://manual.audacityteam.org/man/spectrogram_view.html).

After doing so, the flag will reveal itself:

This is not unlike how Aphex Twin hides images inside their audio!
